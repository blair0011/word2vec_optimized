# word2vec_optimized
This is where I am enhancing word2vec and it's relatives

The base code is from https://github.com/GuntaButya/Word2Vec.Net-CSharp but I have already enhanced it so that 
it doesn't use as much memory while training which also has the effect that it runs in a decent amount of time.

--TODO add in vector addition and subtraction
--TODO use a folder of files as a training set
--TODO Use MKL?
